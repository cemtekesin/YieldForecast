# YieldForecast
This Repository will house the US Corn and Soybeans yield forecasting model I will work on.
Goals: Estimate state level yields from relizied monthly rain and temperature weather maps and calculate national yield. This project will require deep learning methods.
Instead of using state level numeric precipitation and temperature data, using images will be an interesting study.
Further steps can be updating yield forecast with forecasted weather maps.
